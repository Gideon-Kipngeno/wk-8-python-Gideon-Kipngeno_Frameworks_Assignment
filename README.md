# CORD-19 Metadata Analysis with Streamlit

This repository contains a Python-based data analysis and visualization project using the metadata from the CORD-19 research dataset. The goal is to explore COVID-19 research trends and present insights through an interactive Streamlit dashboard.

---

## Project Overview

- **Dataset**: `metadata.csv` from the [CORD-19 Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge)

- **Tools Used**:
  - `pandas` – data loading and manipulation
  - `matplotlib` / `seaborn` – visualizations
  - `Streamlit` – interactive web app
  - `wordcloud` – text visualization
  - `plotly` – interactive charts
  - `numpy` – numerical computations

- **Objectives**:
  - Load and clean real-world research data
  - Perform basic analysis and extract insights
  - Visualize trends in publication dates, journals, and title keywords
  - Build a simple dashboard to present findings interactively

## How to Run

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+ installed
- Git for cloning the repository

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Gideon-Kipngeno/wk-8-python-Gideon-Kipngeno_Frameworks_Assignment.git
cd wk-8-python-Gideon-Kipngeno_Frameworks_Assignment
```
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Download the dataset:

Visit CORD-19 on Kaggle

Download metadata.csv and place it in the project root directory then: 

- Run this file to analyse data
```bash
python data_analysis.py 
```

4. Run the Streamlit app:

```bash
streamlit run app.py 
```
5. Access the application:

Open your web browser to http://localhost:8501

The dashboard will load automatically
